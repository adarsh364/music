      Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic
      line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar,
      vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their
      earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy
      metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and
      radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock
      and pop rock.
